# **DCA Reintegration**

This repository is associated with the [Calvanese,Penetti et al.](https://void) paper. It provides the code for integrating an experimentally labeled dataset to train an experiment-informed Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) generative model for proteins and RNA.

## **Contents**

- **Notebook Implementation**  
  Contains a fully functional and commented Colab notebook demonstrating the application of the reintegration procedure to a DCA generative model. The implementation is showcased in the context of the *Chorismate Mutase* enzyme, building on experimental results obtained in [Russ et al.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba3304)

- **DATA**  
  Includes the dataset used in the main associated publication [Calvanese,Penetti et al.](https://void).

- **Terminal Implementation**  
  Provides instructions on how to apply the reintegration procedure within the `adabmDCA` package via the command line.

## **Usage**
Refer to the Colab notebook for step-by-step guidance on utilizing the reintegration procedure. For command-line execution, follow the instructions in the *Terminal Implementation* section.
